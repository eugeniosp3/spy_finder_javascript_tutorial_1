    <h1>Welcome in. </h1>
    <p>We've been expecting you. It's time. Get acclimated with your surroundings. We'll be in touch momentarily with instructions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>... 5 Minutes Later ...</p>
    <p>When ready. Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
        <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
        <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.</li>
        <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Don't be afraid of the outcome. If the spy is not found, the world continues as it has been. If the spy is found,
        a new one will be assigned not long after.
    </p>

    <p>Here is an example of a previous spy in the mix. Pay close attention to the subtleties in their biography.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jose Johnson</li>
        <li>26 years old</li>
        <li>175 cm tall</li>
        <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want,
        you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name</p>
